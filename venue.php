	  <h4>How to get there? </h4>
	  
	  The best way to get to Pavia is by train. From Milan, the S13 suburban train can be used (with direction to Pavia), and if not, all regional trains on the Milano-Genova/Savona lines pass through Pavia. After arriving at the station, getting to the workshop site should take roughly 15 minutes walking:
